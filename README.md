# Black Friday Case Study

**Guided data analysis project on the Black Friday dataset using Python and pandas as part of the CloudyML course.**

## Project Overview
This dataset comprises sales transactions captured at a retail store. It’s a classic dataset to explore and expand my **feature engineering skills** and gain day-to-day understanding from multiple shopping experiences.  
- The dataset has **550,069 rows and 12 columns**.  
- **Problem statement:** Predict purchase amount.

The project involves analyzing the dataset to understand customer behavior and extract insights using **pandas**.

## Key Activities & Analysis
During my analysis, I performed the following activities:

- Generated descriptive statistical values for numerical columns.  
- Explored categorical columns and their distributions.  
- Calculated the percentage distribution of each product ID and identified the most frequent product.  
- Handled missing values using both dropping and imputing methods.  
- Fetched maximum purchase amount along with complete row details.  
- Found purchase amount for a specified `User_ID` and `Product_ID`.  
- Extracted interesting subsets of the dataset based on given conditions.  
- Identified top 20 revenue-generating customers and their purchased product IDs.  
- Determined the most active age groups for purchasing products from the website.  
- Calculated the total revenue generated via the website.  
- Tagged records as “high focused” transactions where purchase amount exceeded 5000.  
- Analyzed total and average purchase amounts based on gender.
